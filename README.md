This data science project leverages historical medical records to effectively determine the survival probability of horses with colic by utilizing predictive models that evaluate the likelihood of their survival, taking into account past medical conditions.

## Objective
To develop a predictive model capable of estimating the probability of survival for horses affected by colic. This project aims to provide valuable insights to veterinarians and horse owners, enabling them to make well-informed decisions regarding treatment options and care. Furthermore, the objective involves conducting an in-depth analysis to identify the most influential features or attributes for accurately predicting colic occurrences.

## Dataset

Dataset includes 299 rows for training and 89 rows for testing
Before any modification the dataset feature types are 17 objects , 7 floats , 4 ints in total 28.

We have merged and convert all categorical data using one-hot encode
